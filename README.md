# Instapaper Full Developer API

This project is a thin wrapper around the Instapaper Full API. It is a _work-in-progress_ and not all API calls are guaranteed to work.

Note that this API assumes that the caller is a subscriber to Instapaper. See more at [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/api/full).

The project solves my own problem; I need a ruby client to interact with the Instapaper API.
